# EDA-project1
Worked on HR analysis kaggle dataset with more focus towards EDA to  understand dependency of different features on the independent variable. Tried my hands on seaborn and matplotlib library to know the various  aspects of the data(including categorical and continous dependent variables). Models Used are Logistic Regeression and Random Forest Classifier and  achieved 93% accuracy
